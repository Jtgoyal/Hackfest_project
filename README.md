A submission for **Hack</Fest '25** (Problem Statement 6). This project provides a real-time, AI-powered solution for monitoring attendee sentiment and detecting issues during live events.

## 🎯 The Problem

Event organizers frequently struggle to gauge attendee sentiment in real-time. Traditional methods like post-event surveys and manual social media monitoring are too slow to address problems as they arise. Critical issues—such as long queues, poor audio quality, overcrowding, or speaker dissatisfaction—often go unnoticed until after the event, leading to a negative experience and missed opportunities for immediate intervention.

The challenge lies in efficiently aggregating and analyzing feedback from numerous sources like social media, in-app chats, and live Q&A sessions. A manual approach is not only inefficient but also prone to inaccuracies.

## ✨ Our Solution: Event Sentinel

We are building an AI-driven system that empowers event organizers to detect and respond to concerns as they happen, ensuring a seamless and positive event experience.

Our platform will:
*   **Aggregate** feedback from multiple channels in real-time.
*   **Analyze** the sentiment and content of the feedback using advanced AI models.
*   **Alert** organizers to pressing issues and negative sentiment trends instantly.
*   **Provide** a clear and actionable dashboard for quick decision-making.
